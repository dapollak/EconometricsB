$$Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1SAT_j+\beta_2X_{1i}+\beta_3X_{2i}+\epsilon_i$$
\begin{itemize}
\item $X_{1i}$ - observed, $X_{2i}$ - unobserved and incorporated in the error term
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Sub-category
    \end{itemize}
\item Problem arises if $X_{2i}$ is correlated with $X_{1i}$ and is predictive for $Y_i$.
\item Because students can anticipate these admission decisions when they decide where to submit their applications, information about their ability (and perceived chances
of admission) as well as (unconstrained) preferences will be incorporated into their application choices
\item Matched students of \textbf{the same gender} who applied to, were accepted to, and were rejected from similar colleges
\end{itemize}

$$Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1SAT_j+\beta_2X_{1i}+\beta_3X_{2i}+\epsilon_i$$
\begin{itemize}
\item Identification assumption: Conditional on application acceptance, enrollment is uncorrelated with the unobservables that are correlated with outcome of interest (it’s like $Y_i(0)$), it’s like an omitted variable
